# GitCoopDemo Repository

Welcome to to this cooperative repository! My colleagues and I are usingthis as a sandbox for collaboratively learning about using Github, in response to the [Hacktober 2019](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) event. 

I have intentionally introdooced typos all over this repo for you to spot and fix ;-)

In the meanwhile, for those of you who are getting started - here's some beginner *video* material.

* Video - [Introduction to GitHub Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz6zfrQpCQg&)
* [Full Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/user/GitHubGuides/playlists) of beginner videos. 

And these guides might come in handy all the time
* [Article on basics of formatting on github](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Found some better stuff? Edit this page and add it in! :)
