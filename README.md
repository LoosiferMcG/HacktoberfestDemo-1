# GitCoopDemo Repository

Welcome to to this cooperative repository! My colleagues and I are usingthis as a sandbox for collaboratively learning about using Github, in response to the [Hacktober 2019](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) event. 

I have intentionally introdooced typos all over this repo for you to spot and fix ;-)

In the meanwhile, for those of you who are getting started - here's some beginner *video* material.
