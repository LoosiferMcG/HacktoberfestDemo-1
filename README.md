# Hacktoberfest Demo

This is a demo repository for use with [Hacktober 2019](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). Please feel free to use this repo to submit [PRs](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) 

Here are some links to get you started

* [Getting started with Hacktober fest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details)
* [Article on basics of formatting on github](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

This can be used to help learn pulling requests, so if we break it, it is of no consequence - believe me, I'm good at breaking things in IT ;0)

As a suggestion, please consider adding your name to the list of [participants who came by..](misc/Contacts.md)
